 Title: Long-time asymptotics of 3-D axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in critical spaces <br>
Speaker: Yanlin Liu (Beijing Normal University) <br>
Time: June 3rd, 2021 13:50-14:50 <br>
Place: Room 108, Zhiyuan Buildinig <br>
Abstract: We show that any unique global solution (here we do not require any smallness condition beforehand) to 3-D axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in some scaling invariant spaces must eventually become a small solution. In particular, we show that the limits of $\|\omega^\theta(t)/r\|_{L^1}$ and $\|u^\theta(t)/\sqrt r\|_{L^2}$ are all $0$ as $t$ tends to infinity. And by using this, we can refine some decay estimates for the axisymmetric solutions.<br>
